==================================   Project frozen!   ==================================
I don't think the project should receive any public interest for now.
I don't want to raise any expectations, and/or feel pressure from third-parties.
I'm going to continue development, but hopefully in silence.

Biggest factors for making this decision are:
* paradigm shift
* other people
