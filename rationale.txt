1. Wrapper wrapped by wrapper?
 - Yes, I know that's odd, although i should mention, that both wrapper layers are playing different roles in project.
   * First, SWIG-generated moves library into D-world (so if we'll be using D library, it's gone).
   * Second one, converts probably functional interface into OOP world. Furthermore, even if external library API has objects,
     they need to be matched with internal interfaces (so it plays adapter role).
   Maybe in later phase of project this double-wrapper thing will change.
