Resource management:
	memory - GC
	single reference  & time-constrained -  std.typecons : Unique
	multiple reference & time-constrained - std.typecons : RefCounted
Multi-Threading:
	Data layout should match current perspective (when your algorithm is heavier than perspective change)
	Reduce perspective transmission and sharing between processors.
Reference (class) vs. value (struct) types:
	If you'll be mostly copy shallow, use reference type. If you'll be copying deep, use value.
	If your object will be created and destroyed frequently, use value types.
	If you'll access your object frequently, use value types. In another case, use reference.
