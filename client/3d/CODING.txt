Resource management:
	memory - GC
	single reference  & time-constrained -  std.typecons : Unique
	multiple reference & time-constrained - std.typecons : RefCounted
Multi-Threading:
	Data layout should match current perspective (at least on heavy algorithms)
	Reduce perspective transmission and sharing between processors.
