// Explanation of the flags

// DSL_OBJECT_READY : this flag is set when the object is ready
// for operation. This means that the object is allocated and 
// initialized correctly. Every object should have this flag set
// if and only if it is ready for working with it. The fact that
// this flag is set for an object doesn't imply that every object
// contained in it has the flag also set. DEFAULT: FALSE

// DSL_OBJECT_CONSISTENT : this flag is very dependable on the
// nature of the object. The object can be perfectly allocated
// but still be inconsistent. Ex: a TruthTable that contains
// other than 0's or 1's on his conditional probability table.
// This flag imply that every object contained is also consistent. <----- check later !!!
// DEFAULT: TRUE


// Explanation of the functions

// CheckReadiness : this function should check that all the members
// of the object are there (allocated) and, if so, set the flag 
// DSL_OBJECT_READY. This function SHOULD NOT check the readiness of
// the members of the class (no deepening) unless specified otherwise.

// CheckConsistency : this function should check that all the members
// of the object are consistent and, if so, set the flag 
// DSL_OBJECT_CONSISTENT. This function SHOULD check the consistency  <----- check later !!!
// of the members of the class (deepening) unless specified otherwise.

// CleanUp : this function should "clean" the object an leave it
// empty. After this call, the object is probably consistent and
// ready. Think of this function as the destructor of the class (in
// fact, almost every destructor will just invoke CleanUp)            <----- check later !!!
