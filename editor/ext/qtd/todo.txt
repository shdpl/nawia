Before 0.3 release

1) Move nested classes into host classes they belong to
2) connectSlotsByName
3) docs
4) remove deprecated methods (as many as possible)
5) remove mangling of const methods - always reimplement them in D - to reduce binaries size at least a little bit
6) QList!(IQGraphicsItem)
7) const correct QMetaObject (QObject.metaObject() should be const?)
8) fix duic once value types are implemented as structs and add connectSlotsByName call
